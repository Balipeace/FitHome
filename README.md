## Baseline
The baseline is a watts value representing the average number of watts used within a time period of one day.  It is a measurement determined before the user starts practicing electricity conservation.  It is the jumping off point for determining how much electricity is being saved.
# Activities
Activities give targeted guidance on things the user can do to lower the amount of electricity being used without making any lifestyle changes.  Activities address aspects of electricity use like the electricity that is used throughout the day and night by devices that are plugged in but not being used.
## The Info
The info is currated from knowledge we have gained through our own practice as well as recommended by others who know what to do to save electricity.  We gather this information up and put it into the [activities.json](https://github.com/BitKnitting/FitHome/blob/master/assets/activities.json) file.
## From Json to Activities class
The approach taken go go from a Json file to the Activities class includes:  
* Reading the Json into a Jsonified string"
