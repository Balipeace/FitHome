# The FitHome Experience
Welcome.  Think of the FitHome experience as a home health Personal Trainer for the busy homeowner.  During a one month training period, you will get personalized, simple guidance on the easiest way to lower your electricity use.  You will receive immediate feedback on how well you are doing, including the amount of money you are saving and your impact on helping to minimize climate change.  It's amazing how much electricity we waste yet don't have any idea how we can use less with no change to our lifestyle.  Saving electricity means saving money and making a positive impact on climate change. The FitHome Experience  gets us __mindful__ and __connected__ to a future that is reliant on renewable energy.
